CLH lock is a List-Based Queuing Lock that avoids network contention by
having threads spin and on locally accessible memory locations. The main
properties of this mechanism are:

- guarantees FIFO ordering of lock acquisitions;
- spins on locally-accessible flag variables only;
- requires a small constant amount of space per lock; and
- works equally well (requiring only O(1) network transactions per lock
  acquisition) on machines with and without coherent caches.
- avoids the "handshake" runtime overhead between the lock holder and
  its successor during lock release.

This algorithm was indenpendently introduced by [Craig] and
[Magnussen, Landin, and Hagersten] papers.

## Spinlock use cases

It is noteworthy to mention that [spinlocks are usually not what you want].
The majority of use cases are well covered by OS-based mutexes like
[`std::sync::Mutex`], [`parking_lot::Mutex`]. These implementations will
notify the system that the waiting thread should be parked, freeing the
processor to work on something else.

Spinlocks are only efficient in very few circunstances where the overhead
of context switching or process rescheduling are greater than busy waiting
for very short periods. Spinlocks can be useful inside operating-system
kernels, on embedded systems or even complement other locking designs.

## Install

Run the following Cargo command in your project directory:

```bash
cargo add clhlock
```

Or add a entry under the `[dependencies]` section in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
# Cargo.toml

[dependencies]
# Available features: `yield` and `thread_local`.
clhlock = { version = "0.2", features = ["yield", "thread_local"] }
```

## Documentation

This project documentation is hosted at [docs.rs][docs]. Or you can build it
locally with the following command:

```bash
RUSTDOCFLAGS="--cfg docsrs" cargo +nightly doc --all-features --open
```

## Waiting queue node allocations

Queue nodes are allocated in the heap, and their ownership is transparently
moved from the lock holding thread to its successor. Allocating the nodes in
the stack is not allowed since the CLH lock protocol does not guarantee that
a predecessor thread will be live by the time a successor access its
associated locking node. Locking operations require exclusive access to local
node handles that own the heap allocations. Therefore, this crate requires
linking with Rust's core [alloc] library.

## Locking with a raw CLH spinlock

This implementation operates under FIFO. Raw locking APIs require exclusive
access to a locally accessible handle to a heap allocated queue node. This
node handle is represented by the [`raw::MutexNode`] type. This implementation
is `no_std` compatible. See the [`raw`] module for more information.

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::thread;

// `spins::Mutex` simply spins during contention.
use clhlock::raw::{spins::Mutex, MutexNode};

fn main() {
    let mutex = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
    let c_mutex = Arc::clone(&mutex);

    thread::spawn(move || {
        // A queue node handle must be mutably accessible.
        let mut node = MutexNode::new();
        *c_mutex.lock(&mut node) = 10;
    })
    .join().expect("thread::spawn failed");

    // A queue node handle must be mutably accessible.
    let mut node = MutexNode::new();
    assert_eq!(*mutex.lock(&mut node), 10);
}
```

## Thread local raw CLH spinlock nodes

Enables [`raw::Mutex`] locking APIs that operate over queue node handles
that are stored at the thread local storage. These locking APIs require a
static reference to a [`raw::LocalMutexNode`] key. Keys must be generated by
the [`thread_local_node!`] macro. Thread local nodes are not `no_std`
compatible and can be enabled through the `thread_local` feature.

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::thread;

// `spins::Mutex` simply spins during contention.
use clhlock::raw::spins::Mutex;

// Requires `thread_local` feature.
clhlock::thread_local_node!(static NODE);

fn main() {
    let mutex = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
    let c_mutex = Arc::clone(&mutex);
    thread::spawn(move || {
        // Local node handles are provided by reference.
        // Critical section must be defined as a closure.
        c_mutex.lock_with_local(&NODE, |mut guard| *guard = 10);
    })
    .join().expect("thread::spawn failed");

    // Local node handles are provided by reference.
    // Critical section must be defined as a closure.
    assert_eq!(mutex.lock_with_local(&NODE, |guard| *guard), 10);
}
```

## Features

This crate dos not provide any default features. Features that can be enabled
are:

### yield

The `yield` feature requires linking to the standard library, so it is not
suitable for `no_std` environments. By enabling the `yield` feature, instead
of busy-waiting during lock acquisitions and releases, this will call
[`std::thread::yield_now`], which cooperatively gives up a timeslice to the
OS scheduler. This may cause a context switch, so you may not want to enable
this feature if your intention is to to actually do optimistic spinning. The
default implementation calls [`core::hint::spin_loop`], which does in fact
just simply busy-waits. This feature is not `not_std` compatible.

### thread_local

The `thread_local` feature enables [`raw::Mutex`] locking APIs that operate
over queue node handles that are stored at the thread local storage. These
locking APIs require a static reference to [`raw::LocalMutexNode`] keys.
Keys must be generated by the [`thread_local_node!`] macro. This feature is
not `no_std` compatible.
